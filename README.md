This was the task for implementing basic knowledge of node.js which i have learn from node.js course ,
I have design an app to manage Tutorials where I have implemented basic crud and sorting ,searching api's  and all api's are maintained with help of swagger-ui.

The fields are validated using Joi validation and created a pre-commit git hook with use of husky that will check proper code formatting(indentation,semi-colons,quotes) with help of Eslint and prettier.

Followed a proper commit style i.e-conventional commits with use of commitizen
